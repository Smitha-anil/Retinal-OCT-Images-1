1. we applied image augmentation to this dataset.
2. we applied three model - InceptionNet, DenseNet, and ResNet. (also applied VGG16 but accuracy is just 44 percentage with it.)
3. we have taken the weight of every model which is trained on imagenet dataset, we have not freezed the layer because the retina dataset is different from imagenet dataset.
4. we used confusion matrix because dataset is imbalanced and so accuracy score may not give good sence of result.
5. By seeing the confusion matrix of all the three model we can say that inception net has best recall  than other model, precision is also good for inception net.
